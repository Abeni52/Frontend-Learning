      <p>Dear Agent <span class="blurred"> S'more, </span></p>
      <p>
        have an emergency. The secret formula for our
        <span class="blurred"> Mega Marshmallow </span>has been compromised.
        This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most
        delicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        We suspect that <span class="blurred"> Professor Puff </span> is behind
        this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is
        to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this
        information could jeopardize the entire operation.
